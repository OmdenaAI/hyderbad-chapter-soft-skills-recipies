","Think about how much you really want to have sex with other people. If you sometimes feel different than other people because you feel content being single and celibate, ask yourself the following: Do you find that you lack any desire for or attraction to members of either gender? You may think some people are good looking, but do not feel ""turned on"" by looking at them the way your friends seem to be. Or are you attracted to some people of the same and/or opposite gender, but you do not actually want to have sex with those people? Did you try making out with, or having sex with people you felt attracted to, and find you did not enjoy the experience? If you answered ""yes"" to one or more of these questions, you do not need to feel alone or abnormal. There are many others who are asexual like you. Asexuals sometimes enjoy romantic relationships without sex, or with limited sex. Asexuals may seek out just cuddling and physical affection, or they may only want platonic friendships in their life.[1] X Research source There is a strong online support community for asexuals that you may want to reach out to, to seek advice and support on how to handle feeling ""different"" than your single and ""coupled"" friends, and to seek advice on how to pursue the kinds of non-sexual (or quasi-sexual) relationships you want in your life.",0.49913785,-0.06048686

Question 1 of 5:How do I make the first move in bed?
","Try playing the role of the seducer. Don’t wait for your partner to make the first move! Even if they aren’t necessarily in the mood, you can help make it happen by taking charge of the situation yourself. Drop some really obvious hints or maybe pull out some sexy props or toys. You could also try a more playfully aggressive approach and tell your partner what you want them to do. The best part of both you and your partner feeling comfortable initiating sex is that you’ll end up having more sex—it’s a win-win![1] X Research source",0.5214255,0.19106877

Method 1 of 2:Increasing Alcohol Consumption Responsibly
","Know the difference between alcohol tolerance and dependence. Although there is a relationship between alcohol tolerance and dependence, they are not the same thing. A person can increase their alcohol tolerance without becoming dependent, though having too high an alcohol tolerance likely means you are also dependent.[1] X Research source Tolerance means that your body adapts to the consumption of a specific amount of alcohol, even in amounts such as one beer or one glass of wine.[2] X Research source Dependence means that you consistently and compulsively consume alcohol and need it to function, a dangerous state you want to avoid.[3] X Research source If your alcohol tolerance becomes too high, it s likely a sign that you re dependent, which can be dangerous not only for you, but also the people around you.",0.5828145,0.37774307
