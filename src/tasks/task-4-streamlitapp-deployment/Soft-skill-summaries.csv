This can encourage team members to be accountable for their work and motivate everyone on the team to complete their tasks on time."
Project Management,Clear definition of tasks,"As you continue to work on the project, make sure you're updating the to-do list to guide your team's progress toward the project goals. Whenever someone finishes an assignment, you can mark it as complete or ask the team member to remove it from the list. When updating the list, note the date a team member completes the task so you can acknowledge those who meet their deadlines. Updating the do-list throughout a project can help you analyze the project plan, evaluate what's going well and identify areas for improvement to help the team achieve the project outcomes."

Gone are the days where the company provides a safety net for employees, and so employees no longer feel loyalty to the company."

Then organize each step by listing them in order of when they need to be accomplished. Finally, divide the list by assigning different tasks to individual members of your team."
Project Management,Keeping a problem-solving attitude,This a mark of true leaders. The ability to ask the question “How can it be done?” rather than “Can it be done?”.

Respect is demonstrated by how you address someone when making contact, how you speak to them, and how you respond. It's also asking for their opinions with the right tone."
Communication,Tone of expression,"There are elements in the sound of your voice that give meaning to what you’re saying. Whether spoken or unspoken, there are subtle nuances that change the meaning. For example, two people could say the same thing but if they use different vocal tones, the message is received differently. Another example is even if a person is speaking in a foreign language, you can still figure out how they feel through their tone of voice in communication."
Communication,Tone of expression,"The speed and pace at which a person breathes can demonstrate different emotions and their demeanour. Deep and slow breathing usually helps someone to stay calm. This allows them to speak calmly and clearly so that their words are easily understood. Communicating in this manner can also inspire trust in others.

Communication,Tone of expression,"The volume of a person’s voice can be a sign of how they feel and how they interact with others. If someone has a meek and soft voice, it may show that the person is shy or fears confrontation. Conversely, a soft voice can also be intimate and show the listener that you’re compassionate.

Hence, other factors are also important in determining your tone of voice."
Communication,Tone of expression,"Vocalization in communication is the ability to be understood. This means using words carefully to deliver a clear and concise message. Someone who can deliver a speech with clear vocal articulation will be seen as having an informative tone and can demonstrate their authority as an expert. However, someone who stumbles or uses long-winded language can demonstrate a lack of confidence or unclear messaging."
Communication,Tone of expression,"The speed at which a person talks can show you their emotional state. Slow and intentional speech can contribute to a powerful and commanding presence because people have to wait for you to finish speaking. On the other hand, talking slowly can show a lack of interest and apathy, and cause people to be disengaged. Someone who speaks fast could be nervous or overly excited. For example, a person blinded by the prospect of a big sale can start to speak faster than usual. If you’re pitching ideas to your boss without being sufficiently prepared, you might be nervous and speak faster.Being able to control the speed at which you talk can help you to deliver the appropriate tone. Consciously slowing down your speech can help you have a more informative tone."
Communication,Tone of expression,"The tone of voice can have a significant impact on a person's communication skills, which in turn can affect how they work with their teams, how they run a business operation, and how they form relationships with customers and suppliers of the company. There are also many roles that require strong communication skills such as customer service or sales."
Communication,Tone of expression,"Many employees look up to their business leaders. The best leaders are often persuasive and influential so that they can motivate people and get customers to trust them and the brand. Being able to motivate, persuade and influence will require strong mastery of tone of voice. The importance of tone of voice is also demonstrated when a leader needs to project confidence, motivation and compassion appropriately. A commanding presence can also help to increase respect. Hence, a good leader should be able to effectively switch between all five tones of voice when needed."
Communication,Tone of expression,"Team members need to use their words to work effectively in a group setting. Using the wrong tone of voice can damage relationships with other team members and affect the effectiveness and efficiency of your work. It’s also about knowing when to show empathy, use humour or add personality into your words to make you relatable. This also fosters authenticity, honesty, and openness so that you can get along with others."
Communication,Tone of expression,"Mastery over your tone of voice and using the right words at the right time is also very powerful. It can help you to stand out when the time comes for promotions, particularly as senior roles are often managerial roles that require working with many different stakeholders and teams. If you are a team member that makes other people feel like they can rely on you and trust you, that can give you a huge boost in your career prospects."

Communication,Expressing opinion,Think of 1-2 ways you could improve for situations in which you were not as assertive as you would like. Ask yourself questions like where did you show assertive communication? Were there chances for you to be assertive that you missed?
Communication,Expressing opinion,"Ask for opinions and feedback to ensure that they’re engaged in the conversation. Ask more than one person for advice. If you feel like you would benefit from multiple perspectives, feel free to ask multiple people for their opinions."
Communication,Expressing opinion,"Don't be afraid to ask. Plenty of professionals are happy to give some complementary advice. For lighthearted advice, you can create a poll on social media to gather all your friends opinions."
Communication,Expressing opinion,"Many employees have opinions about their workplaces but never voice them for fear of reprisal. This tendency keeps valuable information hidden from those who make decisions. Voicing opinions in a professional manner can boost the profile of an employee and improve the morale of a company. Leaders who are receptive to all opinions, whether they are ideas, constructive feedback or even concerns over a decision, have employees who are more engaged and productive."
Communication,Expressing opinion,"Typically, employees are comfortable voicing opinions to their colleagues and subordinates but not to their bosses. If an employee's relationship with his boss consists of open, honest dialogue, carefully voicing of opinions can often increase respect and deepen the relationship. If the opinion could be perceived as negative, share it privately and as constructively as possible. Leaders who want to establish an open dialogue should listen attentively and thank employees for their thoughts, even if they disagree"
Communication,Expressing opinion,"It is critical to voice your opinions and ideas with peers or leaders because they shape the future of the organization. If the organization is hierarchical, it may be best for employees to use predetermined mechanisms, such as surveys or suggestion boxes. If the organization has created an environment where the importance of opinion is recognized and opinions are solicited and rewarded, then employees should connect directly with peers or leaders or speak up during brainstorming sessions to discuss new ideas."
Communication,Expressing opinion,"Constructive feedback, such as performance feedback, document critiques or feelings about a recent decision, are difficult for some employees to voice, but these opinions are a vital part of improving quality and process. For example, a leader asks an employee to review a sales presentation, but the employee has a suggestion for a better approach. Wherever possible, offer opinions privately to reduce resistance to feedback. Also, communicate the opinion as an opinion and not a fact to quell defensive reactions. It can be crucial to pick tactful language to present your feedback, to prevent defensiveness and steer the conversation to productivity, according to Monster."
Communication,Expressing opinion,"Sometimes, it's prudent to not voice an opinion, depending on the leader, the venue and the other people present. For example, voicing an unpopular opinion in a large forum such a department meeting can create strong, negative reactions. You may be better off to more discretely bring an objection up to the appropriate parties afterwards."
Communication,Expressing opinion,"According to Atlassian, speaking up is only effective when done to the right audience. Leaders who prefer hierarchies or exhibit defensiveness may not respond well to opinions from line employees. Avoid expressing opinions that have already been expressed by others and don’t express a dissenting opinion when an executive has said the decision is final."
Communication,Expressing opinion,"Confidence is never a bad thing to have. In a job interview, it can make you seem like a more appealing candidate. In a deal negotiation, it can make you seem like more of an authority. In a meeting, it can make you look like a more important player. Speaking your opinion openly makes you appear more confident, and that effect actually increases depending on the degree of controversy associated with that opinion. For example, if you strongly disagree with everyone else in the room, you’ll appear more confident than if you go the safe route and openly agree. That confidence will build over time and help propel your career forward."
Communication,Expressing opinion,"A common reason for employees holding their opinions back is a belief that those opinions don't matter—that they won't be listened to, or they won't be acted upon. However, there is no guarantee that your opinion will be ignored or cast aside. If you speak up, your voice might make the difference, but if you hold back, you'll never know what positive outcomes you could be missing out on."
Communication,Expressing opinion,"Even if your opinion isn't taken into serious consideration, the fact that you brought it up can still drive a meaningful discussion. For example, if you offer a possible solution in a group meeting, the group may collectively decide that your idea isn't worth pursuing. However, even so, your opinion could generate some alternative lines of thinking and new perspectives that keep the conversation moving forward. Ultimately, discussion leads to results, and the more opinions there are to feed that discussion, the faster and more efficiently you’ll eventually get to those results."
Communication,Expressing opinion,"Let's say you aren't sure that your opinion is valid, or that you know for a fact that there's something off with it. This could be an indication that your opinion isn’t grounded or isn’t relevant, or it could just be your psyche messing with you. If you want to find out, you have to voice your opinion. If your instincts are right and there is something wrong about your opinion—such as a false assumption or incorrect data—the other people around you will let you know. You won't appear foolish; instead, the situation becomes a genuine learning experience and you can walk away the wiser."
Communication,Expressing opinion,"Sometimes, workers are intimidated to voice their opinions because they feel like they're the only ones who feel a certain way. For example, if you’re sitting in a meeting listening to your boss talk about a new marketing approach and you're concerned that the approach will be ineffective, you might clam up if you feel like the only one of a dissenting mind. However, everybody else in the meeting could be thinking the very same thing. If you voice your opinion, you could give a voice to everyone else. You may have more support than you realize."
Communication,Expressing opinion,"Most of us have a tendency to imagine worst-case scenarios when faced with an intimidating prospect. When you imagine voicing your opinion, you could envision yourself getting fired or humiliated in front of the entire company. In reality, these possible outcomes are extremely rare—the risks of making your opinion known are much lower than they might seem. If your workplace culture is the type that would support firing an employee because he or she voiced an opinion, you probably shouldn't be working there anyway."
Communication,Expressing opinion,"It's possible that you voice your opinion and live to regret it, but it’s also possible that you keep your mouth shut and regret not saying anything. Ultimately, our regrets of inaction are much more severe than our regrets of action, meaning keeping your mouth shut is actually the more likely regret of the two. Take a chance—you'll feel good about it, even if it doesn't turn out how you intended."

Comfort with Ambiguity,Connecting situations' dots together,"One of the traits that differentiates great leaders from the rest is their ability to pull everything together and create a cohesive organization. These types of leaders understand that synergy and teamwork cannot exist with gaps or schisms of any sort. Whether in skills, information, or culture, these individuals focus on connecting the dots to create a stronger mesh of resources. Leaders of this caliber detest holes that exhibit weaknesses in their teams and work hard to fill in those gaps, which bolster effectiveness and enhance overall performance."
Comfort with Ambiguity,Connecting situations' dots together,"Engage with your people. The best leaders make connections with their entire staff individually. The concerted effort of valuing your people makes them feel vital to the team and increases commitment. People who aren't connected can pull away and bring down others around them, so these leaders work hard on this key foundation."
Comfort with Ambiguity,Connecting situations' dots together,"Create connectors within the team. While the ability to connect with everyone is vital, not every leader can build equal rapport with every person. But it’s the intuitive leader who knows which of their people and leaders within the team can be the most effective in developing deeper connections. They create a working environment – whether through small teams, projects, or physical assignments – that allows these relationships to root and grow."
Comfort with Ambiguity,Connecting situations' dots together,"Provide access to all needed resources. Gaps in training and the needed resources to accomplish one’s job are huge barriers to overcome. Without these tools employees get frustrated, and productivity and engagement drop markedly. Great leaders will funnel what their people need and make it accessible for them to learn, develop, and accomplish the goals laid out for them."
Comfort with Ambiguity,Connecting situations' dots together,"Connect information flow and veracity. Whether through gossip, misinformation, or just natural gaps in the chain, information must flow and be trustworthy. A leader who leaves holes for people to fill in the blanks or allows the rumor mill to go unchecked permits toxins to permeate their organization. By verifying information sources, filling in more details, and having accessible points of communication, a leader can ensure a connected and well-informed team that is all on the same page."
Comfort with Ambiguity,Connecting situations' dots together,"Close the physical gaps. Sometimes teams are physically unable to work together. Whether remote locations or individuals in the field, a smart leader will give a physical presence to help everyone feel connected. Methods such as remote 1-to-1 meetings, team lunches, or even using the latest communication technology make for effective ways that people can feel more in touch with their colleagues."
Comfort with Ambiguity,Connecting situations' dots together,"Connect complementary skill sets. If you have two separate teams and one is deficient on customer service while the other is noted for being stellar in service, you may want to mingle the two teams to spread the skills around. Sometimes the tendency is to hoard all of one skill to boost that team’s performance up; but if another team is suffering in the same skill it is demoralizing and counterproductive. By spreading the wealth of talent around, everyone will feel like they're contributing and being supported in their roles."
Comfort with Ambiguity,Connecting situations' dots together,"Align efforts with culture and goals. The best organizations have a culture that permeates everything in the company. When a leader threads through all efforts, goals, and rewards to the culture, they create a powerful engine of dedicated focus on the mission. Strong culture bonds people together while loose culture allows drift in the company."

Collaboration,Taking responsibility,"Today's workplace is arguably more interconnected than ever. What you do may not only affect your own productivity, performance, and success, but your coworkers, teammates, bosses, customers, and so forth. For this reason, it is imperative that you take responsibility for your actions and maintain a high level of personal accountability even in the face of failure."
Collaboration,Taking responsibility,"Taking responsibility for your actions requires the realization that you play a part in every situation or experience and therefore, have some degree of responsibility over the outcomes or consequences. You may have heard it referred to as accountability. It means that your first reaction when a mistake is made or a conflict arises, isn’t to blame others, make excuses, twist the facts, or flat out lie. Instead, you swiftly acknowledge there is a problem, identify your role in it, and implement an action plan to minimize (or entirely eliminate) the chances of it happening again."
Collaboration,Taking responsibility,"It is never easy to take responsibility for your actions, especially when those actions have consequences. But rest assured, it is worth it! As the bestselling author, John C. Maxwell, once said, People who blame others for their failures never overcome them. They simply move from problem to problem. To reach your potential, you must continually improve yourself, and you can't do that if you don't take responsibility for your actions and learn from your mistakes."
Collaboration,Taking responsibility,"Honor your word. People will likely trust you more when your actions align with your words. Commit to personal accountability by following through when you make commitments to yourself, coworkers, friends, or family members, without making excuses."

Rather than blaming others (or 'the world' in general) for a specific outcome (whether it's a good or bad situation), accepting personal responsibility allows you to evaluate your future actions and minimize harm. Additionally, it builds strong relationships and empowers you to influence situations for the better. Whenever you find yourself playing the blame game, take a step back and think about how you contributed to the issue."
Collaboration,Taking responsibility,"Maintain a positive attitude. Ruminating, complaining, and engaging in negative self-talk can make you feel like you’ve lost control, fostering low self-esteem.

Practicing self-care and engaging in positive self-talk is a great way to build self-confidence."

Collaboration,Taking responsibility,"Honesty when admitting an error and the moral character to cheer others on for their accomplishments helps to develop trust in the workplace. Coworkers will value your presence, input, and relationship when they view you as a comrade rather than competition. You can establish trust with colleagues by recognizing their contributions, working together to reach a goal, sharing ideas to improve workplace success, and showing a genuine interest in them and their personal lives. Although you don't have to be best friends with everyone at your job, learning about other people shows you value their individuality and respect them. Develop mutual respect with coworkers and supervisors to develop trust, credibility, and foster a healthy company culture."

Communication,Choice of words,"Emotions are reactions; they have causes. Only be describing emotions in a vacuum if the feeling is due to some hormonal imbalance or repressed memory.

The most important leadership skill is therefore the ability to effectively manage, harness and leverage the constant change around us — and this can be done through foresight."
Negotiation,Forseeing situations,"According to famed futurist Richard Slaughter, foresight (also known as futures thinking or futuring) is “the ability to create and maintain a high-quality, coherent and functional forward view, and to use the insights arising in useful organizational ways.”2 In other words, foresight is a way to examine the paths the future might take, using qualitative and quantitative metrics, and then use the insights gained from this analysis to navigate our uncertain and changing world with purpose."

Talk to others and learn from their biases too, especially teenagers!"
Negotiation,Forseeing situations,"As a leader, you're already seeking out news and information that might affect your work and your industry, but that’s not enough.

Follow someone on Twitter who focuses on topics you're normally not interested in."
Negotiation,Forseeing situations,"The natural next step of scanning is to use your imagination. Challenge yourself to think of provocative implications of ideas, innovations and events. Connect the dots between seemingly disparate pieces of information. Think provocatively — as said by legendary futurist Jim Dator, 'any useful idea about the future should appear to be ridiculous.'' In 20, 30, 50 years, what might happen because of a trend we see today? If you are afraid to let your mind wander, you'll never find yourself at the leading edge."

Negotiation,Forseeing situations,"In other words, although foresight is looking to the future, foresight serves the present. Leaders look to likely future possibilities based on diverse possible decisions and scenarios, and then they return to the present to guide present-day decision making in light of this future-looking foresight activity."
Negotiation,Forseeing situations,"As you look at the past, present, and possible futures in your organization, what narrative threads and patterns emerge?
