","Think about how much you really want to have sex with other people. If you sometimes feel different than other people because you feel content being single and celibate, ask yourself the following: Do you find that you lack any desire for or attraction to members of either gender? You may think some people are good looking, but do not feel ""turned on"" by looking at them the way your friends seem to be. Or are you attracted to some people of the same and/or opposite gender, but you do not actually want to have sex with those people? Did you try making out with, or having sex with people you felt attracted to, and find you did not enjoy the experience? If you answered ""yes"" to one or more of these questions, you do not need to feel alone or abnormal. There are many others who are asexual like you. Asexuals sometimes enjoy romantic relationships without sex, or with limited sex. Asexuals may seek out just cuddling and physical affection, or they may only want platonic friendships in their life.[1] X Research source There is a strong online support community for asexuals that you may want to reach out to, to seek advice and support on how to handle feeling ""different"" than your single and ""coupled"" friends, and to seek advice on how to pursue the kinds of non-sexual (or quasi-sexual) relationships you want in your life.",0.49913794,0.07187284

Question 1 of 5:How do I make the first move in bed?
","Try playing the role of the seducer. Don’t wait for your partner to make the first move! Even if they aren’t necessarily in the mood, you can help make it happen by taking charge of the situation yourself. Drop some really obvious hints or maybe pull out some sexy props or toys. You could also try a more playfully aggressive approach and tell your partner what you want them to do. The best part of both you and your partner feeling comfortable initiating sex is that you’ll end up having more sex—it’s a win-win![1] X Research source",0.52142537,0.19106871
